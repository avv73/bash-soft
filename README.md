# BashSoft
A general assignment in the SoftUni's C# Advanced, C# OOP Basics and Advanced courses, which contains all fundamental and advanced C# skills and programming techniques, especially the SOLID principle. I will be developing it as I progress throughout the courses.
Read the resources for the specified course for more info. 

The project resembles a small bash-like terminal program, which has the following functions:
- `cdabs` - Changes the absolute path
- `cdrel` - Changes the relative path
- `cmp` - Compares two files
- `display` - Prints on the console all courses/students in ascending/descending order
- `dropdb` - Drop database
- `filter` - Filters students by courses
- `help` - Shows help menu
- `ls` - Traverse folder
- `mkdir` - Creats new folder
- `open` - Opens file
- `order` - Orders students in courses
- `quit` - Closes the program
- `readdb` - Reads database
- `show` - Shows all students in course
